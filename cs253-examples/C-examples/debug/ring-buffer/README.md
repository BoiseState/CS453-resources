===================

YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS README.md FILE BEFORE SUBMITTING!

To run the test programs you will need to set the paths to find the library:

```

Then run the test programs as follows:

```
./grader
```

Or the run.sh script will set the path for you and execute valgrind:
