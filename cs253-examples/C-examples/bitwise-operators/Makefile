# The following are macros: a defintion on one line with an equal

# macro CFLAGS defines the default set of options or flags used
# with the C compiler.

# Recognize files with .c and .o extensions
.SUFFIXES: .o .c

# This is a rule to convert a file with .c extension
# into a file with a .o extension. The macro $< just
# supplies the name of the file (without the extension)
# that invoked this rule.
.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

# The following is a dependency or a rule line. It has the
# name of the rule followed by a colon. After the colon are listed
# other rules that this rule depends upon. Following the rules line
# are one or more command lines that must start with a TAB character.
all: getbits bitmanip shift-overflow pack simple

# Another rule below. This depends upon the rule hello.o but we don't
# have any such rule. However make recognizes the suffix .o and uses
# the .c.o rule above to locate the hello.c file and builds the hello.o
# using the .c.o rule.
getbits: getbits.o bitmanip.o shift-overflow.o pack.o simple.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $< -o $@

# A rule most that all Makefiles should have. This one removes
# any .o files and other undesirables that are  lying around and
# the executable hello and leaves only the source. Useful for running
# before submitting a program!
clean:
