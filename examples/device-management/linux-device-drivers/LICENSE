From the Linux Device Drivers by Rubini and Corbet (O'Reilly).

Unless  otherwise stated, the  source code distributed  with this book
can   be  redistributed in source    or  binary form   so  long  as an
acknowledgment  appears in derived source   files. The citation should
list that the code comes from BOOK  by AUTHOR, published by O'Reilly &
Associates.  This  code is under copyright and  cannot be  included in
any other book, publication, or educational product without permission
from O'Reilly &  Associates. No warranty  is attached; we  cannot take
responsibility for errors or fitness for use.


Note  that   although everything here  is  designed  to allow building
binary modules, I'm strongly against this practice. All software in my
opinion should be  free (in the  sense  of freedom). Every Linux  user
should acknowledge the importance of the GPL and should use it for any
new software.
