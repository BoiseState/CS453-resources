#Project XXX

* Author: Your Name
* Class: CS453 Section x

##Overview

Concisely explain what the program does. If this exceeds a couple of
sentences, you're going too far. Generally you should be pulling this
right from the project specification. I don't want you to just cut and
paste, but paraphrase what is stated in the project specification.

##Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to build your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. If you are
delivering a library, where does it need to be installed or how do you
use it? Is this an executable, if so how can a user get up to speed as
fast as possible.

##Testing

This section should detail how you tested your code. Simply stating 
"I ran it a few times and it seems to work" is not sufficient. Your 
testing needs to be detailed here or even better, this section should 
document the appropriate smoke/unit/system tests that you wrote.

##Discussion

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the project did you find challenging? Is there anything
that finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this
project?

##Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
