Build the interposer library using the Makefile.

make

Then use the following to use it to intercept the standard C library read function.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. LD_PRELOAD=libread1.so test-read  README

Then also test it using the test-read program.


The first read example was taken from (but modified and added to):

http://www.lostwebsite.net/2010/01/ld_preload-fun/


The second example shows how to interpose and then continue calling the
original library call. To try it, use


LD_PRELOAD=libread2.so testread   README
