Modified by Amit Jain to show how to load a non-rentrant library twice
using dlopen to avoid race conditions...a crude hack!

The purpose of these programs is to demonstrate the loading of libraries
during runtime.  Important points to note is that the loading program 
and the libraries generally have to have an agreed upon set of symbols
so that the loading program can use the library.  Frequently the library
will have an _init function, but in the case of my programs, the libraries
have the functions message1 and message2.

--- Compiling/Linking Options ---
---------------------------------

-c		: compile without linking
-fPIC		: Emits position-independent code, suitable for dynamic
		  linking, even if branches need large displacements.
-shared		: Produce  a  shared  object which can then be linked
		  with other objects to form an executable.  Only a
		  few systems support this option.
(ld)-rdynamic	: When creating an ELF file, add all symbols to the dynamic
		 symbol table.  Normally, the dynamic symbol table contains
		 only symbols which are used by a dynamic object.  This
		 option is needed for some uses of dlopen.
(ld)-ldl	: Links libdl to the file.
