Good Email Questions
\end{center}

I encourage you to ask questions about homework during
lectures, during office hours, and via email. Email can be
most the most productive medium, because verbatim material
can be shared. To improve email-communication productivity,
please:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a good subject line, such as:
  \begin{Verbatim}
  Subject: CS 354-1: LA1: question about cons
  \end{Verbatim}
\item Ask your question in the initial email. Don't say
  something like: ``I'm stuck. Can I ask a question?''
\item Show me what you have tried, and what happened. Don't
  say something like: ``My program doesn't work.''
\item Provide \emph{text} fragments of what you have tried,
  and what happened. Don't send screenshots or images. When
  you cut-and-paste text, I can try what you tried, and
  reply with modified text.
\item If appropriate, attach complete text files.  Then, I
  can compile, change, and reply with modified files.
\item Warn me if you are using a computer other than
  \texttt{onyx} or one of its nodes.
\item Don't assume that I have saved, or remember, the
  ``thread'' of our conversation from previous emails.
\end{itemize}
