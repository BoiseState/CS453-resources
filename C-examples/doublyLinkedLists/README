This folder contains various versions of a doubly linked list class in C. Beware that 
all of the implementations are incomplete, that is they do not contain all the functions 
you would expect in a doubly linked list class. The idea is that you need to complete 
the stub (dummy) functions and make the class be more usable.

Here is what the different folders contain:


almost-generic/   Contains a self-contained implementation of a doubly linked list
                  that is almost generic. To use it to store different objects, you
                  have to make a few modifications to the code each time. 

generic/        Contains two examples that use the fully generic doubly linked list 
                code. The linked list code is still included in the folder. So
				you still have to copy it to each project you want to use it
				in. However, the code is generic and you don't have to change
				it to store different objects in the list.

generic-with-library/ Contains a fully generic library version of doubly linked lists. You can 
                store any kind of objects in this list without having to modify the library code. 
				The Makefile file in this folder builds the library and installs it in the lib/
                subfolder. It installs the header files in the include/ subfolder.  


bad/            A version of the doubly-linked list with memory leaks and errors to demo
                purposes. Use that with valgrind for learn how to use valgrind for 
                memory checks. See the README file in that folder.
