Documentation
-------------

Generate documentation using the Doxygen tool. Use 

` make dox `

to trigger Doxygen. Use the sample `doxygen-config` file for using with your
project. Note that, just like javadocs, you can use any HTML tags in your
comments. All javadoc tags and comments (as well as Markdown) are supported by Doxygen.
